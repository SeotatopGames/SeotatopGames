-- 	NODE TYPES 	--
This will go into further detail about how each node is handled.

- Null Node - 
A node that will not be used for anything beyond spawning a pellet. They do not get added to the Ghosts Navigation Node.

- Travel Node - 
A simple node that the ghosts can use to travel around. Does not use any extra data.

- Teleport Node -
A teleport node is a node that, upon a ghost stepping on the tile will, be warped to the tile with the ID that is set in the ExtraData Variable slot.

- Player Spawn Node -
Acts like a Null Node, however will dictate where the player should spawn/respawn on the map. ID Should be set higher than the size of the Array to avoid gaps in the map or ID Conflicts. 

- Ghost Spawn Node -
Acts like a Travel Node, however it will dictate where the specified ghost will spawn and retreat to when defeated. There should only ever be one of these per ghost. ID should not be modified as it will be used to link the ghosts into the rest of the movement network.
